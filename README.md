# A Bot Named David

David is a JavaScript Chatbot I built leveraging a Davinci-003 endpoint.

# How Does David Work?

GPT-3 (the 3rd iteration of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer developed by OpenAI) is capable of natural language processing tasks.
The "Davinci" models are known for their enhanced text completion capabilities, and so are sometimes used in tasks like chatting with people.


# Plans For David

My intent is for David to be an animated chatbot that lives in-browser, and potentially on a mobile app.
Currently, David accepts and responds to 1 query at a time. He promptly forgets the query after answering it.
I would like to integrate a way for him to remember users, their unique API keys, and their conversations. 
I'd like him to develop a complementerary way of speaking that is unique to each user.
